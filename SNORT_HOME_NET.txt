Snort by default, is configured to process traffic from the external net to the internal one.
In order to change this behavior.

Edit this section in /etc/snort/snort.conf:
 
# Setup the network addresses you are protecting
var HOME_NET [192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8]

# Set up the external network addresses. Leave as "any" in most situations

#var EXTERNAL_NET any

var EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET
